# Overview
The Server Security Audit tool is a comprehensive solution designed to help administrators, DevOps engineers, and security professionals assess and improve the security posture of public-facing servers. It automates a suite of essential security checks that would typically require multiple specialized tools and expertise to perform manually.

Key features of this tool include:

- **Comprehensive Security Assessment**: Tests multiple aspects of server security from network exposure to configuration issues
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows systems 
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides both summary and in-depth results with actionable recommendations
- **Non-Invasive Testing**: Read-only operations that don't modify your systems
- **Educational Resource**: Serves as a knowledge base with explanations and remediation tips

Whether you're preparing a server for production deployment, conducting regular security audits, or responding to security incidents, this tool provides valuable insights into your server's security posture.

---

# How the Audit Works
The Server Security Audit tool employs a modular architecture where each security check is implemented as a separate Python module that integrates with external security tools. When you run the audit, the following process takes place:

1. **Initialization**: The tool sets up the necessary environment, validates prerequisites, and creates directories for output.

2. **Target Selection**: You specify the target server by hostname or IP address.

3. **Check Selection**: You choose which security checks to run (or select all).

4. **Execution**: For each selected check, the tool:
   - Calls the appropriate Python module
   - Executes the relevant external tools with appropriate parameters
   - Captures output and logs for analysis
   - Processes results to identify security issues
   
5. **Reporting**: Results are consolidated into:
   - A summary report with key findings
   - Detailed logs for each check
   - Color-coded or severity-marked results
   - Recommendations for addressing issues

Each security check is designed to run independently, so you can choose which ones are relevant to your specific needs. The modular design also makes it easy to extend the tool with additional checks in the future.

# Detailed Check Explanations

## Port Scan
- **What it does:** Uses `nmap` to scan all TCP ports (1-65535) on the target to identify which ports are open and what services are running.
- **Implementation details:** Executes `nmap -sS -Pn -p-` (or configured options) to perform a SYN scan of all TCP ports. The SYN scan is less intrusive than a full TCP connect scan and is less likely to be logged.
- **Why it matters:** Open ports expose services to the network. Each open port is a potential entry point for attackers, increasing your attack surface. Every unnecessary service increases your vulnerability footprint.
- **What to look for:** 
  - Unexpected open ports
  - High-risk services: Telnet (23), FTP (21), SMB/CIFS (139/445)
  - Admin interfaces exposed to public networks (cPanel, phpMyAdmin, RDP)
  - Services running on non-standard ports (potential hidden services)
- **Common vulnerable ports:**

| **Port** | **Service** | **Common Vulnerabilities** | **Risk Level** |
|------|---------|------------------------|------------|
| 22 | SSH | Brute-force attacks, outdated implementations | üü† Medium-High |
| 23 | Telnet | Unencrypted traffic, credential theft | üî¥‚ÄºÔ∏è Critical |
| 21 | FTP | Unencrypted credentials, anonymous access | üî¥ High |
| 25 | SMTP | Open relay, spam forwarding | üü† Medium |
| 53 | DNS | Cache poisoning, amplification attacks | üü† Medium-High |
| 80/443 | HTTP/HTTPS | Web vulnerabilities, outdated software | üî¥ High |
| 139/445 | SMB/CIFS | Remote code execution (EternalBlue) | üî¥‚ÄºÔ∏è Critical |
| 1433 | MS SQL | Database access, weak credentials | üî¥ High |
| 3306 | MySQL | Database access, weak configurations | üî¥ High |
| 3389 | RDP | BlueKeep, connection hijacking | üî¥‚ÄºÔ∏è Critical |
| 8080 | Alt HTTP | Administration interfaces, proxies | üü† Medium-High |
- **Remediation:** 
  - Close unused ports via firewall rules
  - Restrict access to necessary IPs only via firewall
  - Consider moving services to non-standard ports (security by obscurity, a small additional layer)
  - Implement network segmentation to isolate critical services
  - Use TCP wrappers or equivalent access controls where applicable

## Service/Version Scan
- **What it does:** Uses `nmap` with version detection (-sV) and script scanning (-sC) to identify services, versions, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Implementation details:** Runs `nmap -sV -sC` on ports identified during the port scan. The tool uses service fingerprinting and banner grabbing techniques to identify software versions.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - Outdated or vulnerable services are prime targets for attackers
  - Knowing exact versions helps with vulnerability correlation
  - Unnecessary service details in banners provide attackers with valuable information
- **What to look for:** 
  - Services with known CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
  - End-of-life software versions no longer receiving security updates
  - Default configurations or installations
  - Excessive version information in banners
- **Vulnerability correlation:**
  - Apache < 2.4.50: Path Traversal (CVE-2021-41773)
  - OpenSSH < 8.4: User Enumeration
  - WordPress < 5.8.3: Multiple vulnerabilities
- **Remediation:** 
  - Update all services to the latest stable version
  - Implement a patch management system/schedule
  - Disable unnecessary services
  - Remove version information from banners where possible
  - Subscribe to security advisories for installed software

## UDP Port Scan
- **What it does:** Uses `nmap` to scan for open UDP ports, which are often overlooked but can be critical for security.
- **Implementation details:** Executes `nmap -sU --top-ports 100` to test the most commonly used UDP ports. UDP scanning is slower than TCP, so only top ports are scanned by default.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - UDP services are frequently forgotten in security audits
  - Many critical services use UDP: DNS (53), SNMP (161), NTP (123)
  - UDP services are commonly used in amplification DDoS attacks
- **What to look for:** 
  - UDP ports that shouldn't be publicly accessible:
    - SNMP (161): Can leak system information
    - NTP (123): Potential for NTP amplification attacks
    - DNS (53): Zone transfers, cache poisoning if misconfigured
    - NetBIOS/LDAP (137-139): Can reveal internal network information
    - TFTP (69): Should never be internet-accessible
- **Attack scenarios:**
  - DNS amplification: Open recursive DNS resolvers
  - SNMP information disclosure: Default community strings
  - RPC vulnerabilities via UDP ports
- **Remediation:** 
  - Block unnecessary UDP services at the firewall
  - Configure SNMP with strong community strings or preferably SNMPv3
  - Secure DNS servers and disable recursive queries if not needed
  - Implement rate limiting for UDP services that must remain open

## Directory Brute-Force
- **What it does:** Uses `gobuster` with wordlists to discover hidden or unlinked directories and files on web servers.
- **Implementation details:** Executes gobuster with a selected wordlist against the target URL, making HTTP requests for each potential path.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - Hidden directories can contain sensitive data, backup files, or admin interfaces
  - Developers often leave test, debug, or backup files on production servers
  - Default installations may include sample files with vulnerabilities
- **What to look for:** 
  - Admin panels: `/admin`, `/administrator`, `/wp-admin`, `/phpmyadmin`
  - Backup files: `.bak`, `.old`, `.backup`, `~`, `.swp`
  - Configuration files: `.env`, `.config`, `web.config`, `.htaccess`
  - Version control: `.git`, `.svn`
  - Test or development files: `/test`, `/dev`, `/stage`
  - Sensitive data: `/backup`, `/db`
- **Common findings and risks:**
  - Exposed .git directories can lead to source code disclosure
  - Backup files may contain credentials or sensitive data
  - Admin interfaces with weak credentials
  - Debug endpoints that reveal application details
- **Remediation:** 
  - Remove or restrict access to sensitive directories
  - Implement proper access controls and authentication
  - Use robots.txt to guide legitimate crawlers, but don't rely on it for security
  - Configure web server to prevent directory listing
  - Regularly audit web content for unintended exposures

## Certificate Details
- **What it does:** Uses `openssl` to fetch and comprehensively analyze SSL/TLS certificates from the target server.
- **Implementation details:** 
  - Connects to the target using OpenSSL's s_client
  - Extracts and parses certificate information
  - Checks certificate chain validity
  - Reviews expiry dates and certificate properties
- **Why it matters:** 
  - Expired or invalid certificates create browser warnings and diminish user trust
  - Weak cryptography can lead to interception of encrypted traffic
  - Self-signed certificates bypass trusted CA validation
  - Incorrect certificates expose users to man-in-the-middle attacks
- **What to look for:** 
  - **Validity period:** Certificates expiring soon (< 30 days) or already expired
  - **Signature algorithm:** Weak algorithms like SHA-1 or MD5 should not be used
  - **Key length:** RSA keys should be at least 2048 bits, ECC keys at least 256 bits
  - **Subject Alternative Names (SANs):** Ensure all domains served are covered
  - **Certificate chain:** Complete and properly constructed
  - **Certificate Authority:** Issued by a trusted CA, not self-signed
  - **Revocation status:** Whether the certificate appears on CRL or OCSP
- **Critical certificate issues:**
  - Hostname mismatch between certificate and server
  - Expired certificates
  - Self-signed certificates in production
  - Insecure cipher suites enabled
  - Missing intermediate certificates
- **Remediation:** 
  - Deploy certificates from trusted CAs (Let's Encrypt offers free options)
  - Implement automatic certificate renewal
  - Use modern cipher suites and protocols (TLS 1.2+, disable SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0/1.1)
  - Configure HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
  - Ensure complete certificate chains
  - Use tools like SSL Labs to verify configuration

## DNS Enumeration
- **What it does:** Uses `dig` and other tools to gather DNS records and test for misconfigurations like zone transfers.
- **Implementation details:** 
  - Executes a series of `dig` commands for different record types
  - Performs basic lookups for A, MX, NS, and TXT records
  - Attempts DNS zone transfers (AXFR) to check for this critical misconfiguration
  - Cleans URLs by removing protocol prefixes and paths to focus on the domain
  - Results are combined into a comprehensive DNS report
- **Why it matters:** 
  - DNS records can reveal network architecture and potential targets
  - Misconfigured DNS can leak internal IPs or hostnames
  - Zone transfers can expose your entire DNS infrastructure when incorrectly configured
  - DNS is a critical infrastructure component often overlooked in security reviews
  - DNS misconfigurations can lead to domain hijacking
- **What to look for:** 
  - Exposed internal IP addresses in public DNS records
  - Outdated or forgotten subdomains pointing to vulnerable systems
  - Unintended information in TXT records (SPF, verification codes, API keys)
  - Successful zone transfers to unauthorized servers
  - Misaligned MX records that could lead to mail flow issues
  - Missing or misconfigured DMARC, SPF, or DKIM records
  - Inconsistencies between authoritative nameservers
  - Excessive TTL values or extremely low TTL values
- **Common DNS vulnerabilities:**
  - DNS Zone Transfer (AXFR) allowed to unauthorized hosts
  - DNS cache poisoning susceptibility 
  - Missing DNSSEC implementation
  - Subdomain takeover opportunities (orphaned DNS records)
  - Dangling CNAME records pointing to decommissioned services
  - DNS amplification vulnerabilities from misconfigured recursion
- **Remediation:** 
  - Restrict zone transfers to authorized IP addresses only
  - Implement DNSSEC to prevent spoofing and cache poisoning
  - Regularly audit all DNS records and remove unused entries
  - Secure DNS management interfaces with strong authentication
  - Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for email security
  - Consider using DNS providers with built-in security features
  - Monitor for unexpected DNS changes that could indicate compromise
  - Use split-horizon DNS to separate internal and external DNS
  - Implement proper TTL values

## HTTP Headers
- **What it does:** Uses `curl` to fetch HTTP response headers and analyzes them for security best practices and misconfigurations.
- **Implementation details:** 
  - Makes HTTP requests with different user agents
  - Specifically identifies and analyzes security-related headers
  - Checks for information leakage in server headers
- **Why it matters:** 
  - HTTP headers form a critical part of web security controls
  - Proper security headers can prevent many common web attacks
  - Missing headers can make sites vulnerable to XSS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing
  - Server headers can leak sensitive version information
- **What to look for:** 

| **Security Header** | **Recommended Value** | **Purpose** | **Risk if Missing** |
|----------------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| Content-Security-Policy | `default-src 'self';` (tighten as needed) | Controls resources the browser can load | XSS vulnerabilities |
| X-Frame-Options | `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` | Prevents clickjacking attacks | UI redressing attacks |
| X-XSS-Protection | `1; mode=block` | Additional XSS protection for older browsers | XSS in legacy browsers |
| X-Content-Type-Options | `nosniff` | Prevents MIME type confusion | MIME confusion attacks |
| Strict-Transport-Security | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` | Forces HTTPS connections | SSL stripping attacks |
| Referrer-Policy | `no-referrer` or `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` | Controls referrer information | Information leakage |
| Permissions-Policy | `geolocation=(), microphone=()` | Restricts browser features | Abuse of browser APIs |
| Cache-Control | `no-store, max-age=0` (for sensitive data) | Controls browser caching | Sensitive data exposure |
| Server | Minimal information or custom value | Hides server details | Information disclosure |
- **Common header vulnerabilities:**
  - Missing CSP allowing arbitrary script execution
  - Missing X-Frame-Options enabling clickjacking attacks
  - Verbose Server headers revealing exact versions
  - Missing HSTS headers allowing SSL stripping
- **Remediation:** 
  - Implement a comprehensive Content-Security-Policy
  - Add all recommended security headers
  - Configure web server to remove or obfuscate version information
  - Use HTTP security evaluation tools (like securityheaders.com)
  - Set appropriate caching policies for different content types

## Firewall Status
- **What it does:** Checks if a firewall is active and properly configured on the target system.
- **Implementation details:** Examines firewall configuration and rule sets for UFW, iptables, Windows Firewall, or other firewall solutions.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - Firewalls are the first line of defense for network security
  - Misconfigured firewalls give a false sense of security
  - Default configurations may not be sufficient
  - Firewall rules should follow the principle of least privilege
- **What to look for:** 
  - Firewall service status (active vs. disabled)
  - Default policies (should default to DROP or REJECT)
  - Overly permissive rules (any:any)
  - Rules allowing access to sensitive ports from public networks
  - Inconsistent or conflicting rules
  - Rules with no logging
  - Outdated or unused rules
- **Common firewall misconfigurations:**
  - Default ACCEPT policies
  - Allowing all outbound traffic without restrictions
  - Firewall enabled but with no effective rules
  - Rules that are too broad in scope
  - Rules ordered incorrectly (specific rules should precede general ones)
- **Remediation:** 
  - Ensure firewall is enabled at boot
  - Set default policies to DROP
  - Implement explicit rules for necessary services only
  - Restrict source IPs where possible
  - Enable logging for denied traffic
  - Regularly audit and clean up rule sets
  - Consider implementing both host and network firewalls

## User Privileges
- **What it does:** Lists users with sudo/admin rights and analyzes account security.
- **Implementation details:** Examines /etc/sudoers, local group membership, and user account properties.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - Administrative accounts are primary targets for attackers
  - Excessive privileges violate the principle of least privilege
  - Shared admin accounts reduce accountability
  - Inappropriate sudo configuration can lead to privilege escalation
- **What to look for:** 
  - Users with unexpected sudo/admin privileges
  - Default or system accounts with elevated privileges
  - Passwordless sudo configurations
  - Sudo configurations without command restrictions
  - Inactive accounts that still have privileges
  - Service accounts with interactive login capability
- **Common privilege issues:**
  - Too many users with full sudo access
  - Weak password policies for privileged accounts
  - Shared admin credentials
  - No audit trail for privileged commands
  - Misconfigured sudoers entries that allow escalation
- **Remediation:** 
  - Limit admin/sudo access to necessary personnel only
  - Use fine-grained sudo configurations (specific commands only)
  - Enable command logging for all privileged operations
  - Require password re-entry for sudo
  - Implement MFA for privileged accounts
  - Regularly audit admin group membership
  - Remove inactive accounts from privileged groups

## World-Writable Files
- **What it does:** Scans the filesystem for files or directories that are writable by any user on the system.
- **Implementation details:** Uses find commands to identify files with 777, 757, 775, or other world-writable permissions.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - World-writable files can be modified by any user, including attackers
  - They often lead to privilege escalation
  - Configuration files that are world-writable can be altered to introduce backdoors
  - Executable files that are world-writable can be replaced with malicious versions
- **What to look for:** 
  - System binaries or configuration files with incorrect permissions
  - World-writable directories in the PATH
  - World-writable startup scripts or cron jobs
  - Unexpected world-writable files outside of designated areas like /tmp
  - Files owned by privileged users but writable by all
  - SUID/SGID executables that are world-writable
- **Risk scenarios:**
  - Privilege escalation via writable SUID binaries
  - Persistence through modified startup scripts
  - Data exfiltration through altered logging configurations
  - Service hijacking by modifying configuration files
- **Remediation:** 
  - Correct permissions on system files (usually 644 for data, 755 for directories, 700 for sensitive files)
  - Use the sticky bit (1000) on shared directories like /tmp
  - Regularly audit file permissions
  - Use tools like AIDE or Tripwire to detect unexpected changes
  - Implement proper umask settings (022 or stricter)
  - Consider mandatory access controls (SELinux, AppArmor)

## SSH Configuration
- **What it does:** Reviews SSH server settings against security best practices.
- **Implementation details:** Analyzes /etc/ssh/sshd_config or equivalent for security parameters and compares against hardening guidelines.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - SSH is often exposed to the internet and a primary target
  - Default configurations are often too permissive
  - SSH provides direct system access, making it critical to secure
  - Brute force attacks against SSH are extremely common
- **What to look for:** 

| **SSH Configuration Parameter** | **Recommended Setting** | **Security Impact** | **Default Setting Risk** |
|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| PermitRootLogin | `no` | Prevents direct root access | üî¥ High |
| PasswordAuthentication | `no` | Requires key-based authentication | üî¥ High |
| PubkeyAuthentication | `yes` | Enables key-based authentication | üü† Medium |
| X11Forwarding | `no` | Prevents X11 session hijacking | üü† Medium |
| MaxAuthTries | `3` or `4` | Limits authentication attempts | üü† Medium |
| Protocol | `2` | Uses only secure SSH protocol version | üî¥ High |
| PermitEmptyPasswords | `no` | Prevents blank password usage | üî¥‚ÄºÔ∏è Critical |
| ClientAliveInterval | `300` (5 min) | Auto-disconnects idle sessions | üü¢ Low |
| ClientAliveCountMax | `3` | Number of checks before disconnecting | üü¢ Low |
| AllowUsers/AllowGroups | Specific users/groups | Restricts who can connect | üü† Medium |
| Banner | Custom without system info | Avoids information disclosure | üü¢ Low |
| ListenAddress | Specific IP(s) | Limits SSH access to specific interfaces | üü† Medium |
| LogLevel | `VERBOSE` | Increases logging detail | üü¢ Low |
| UsePAM | `yes` | Integrates with PAM for enhanced security | üü† Medium |
- **Common SSH vulnerabilities:**
  - Root login allowed with password authentication
  - SSH protocol 1 enabled (insecure)
  - Default port with no additional protection
  - Weak ciphers or MACs enabled
  - No login attempt limits
- **Remediation:** 
  - Configure key-based authentication only
  - Disable root login via SSH
  - Implement fail2ban or similar to prevent brute-forcing
  - Use strong ciphers only (remove weak ciphers)
  - Consider changing the default port (22)
  - Restrict SSH access to specific IPs where possible
  - Implement MFA for SSH access
  - Set appropriate timeout values

## Ping/Availability
- **What it does:** Uses ICMP echo (ping) to verify basic connectivity and measure latency to the target.
- **Implementation details:** Sends 4 ICMP echo requests and analyzes responses, with platform-specific commands for different operating systems.
- **Why it matters:** 
  - Establishes basic reachability
  - Measures latency which can impact service performance
  - Identifies packet loss which can indicate network issues
  - Some firewalls block ICMP, which can affect network diagnostics
- **What to look for:** 
  - Packet loss percentage
  - Average round-trip time
  - Consistent vs. varying latency
  - ICMP being completely blocked (could indicate firewall rules)
  - Unusual response patterns
- **Network insights from ping results:**
  - High latency might indicate network congestion or routing issues
  - Packet loss patterns can reveal intermittent connectivity problems
  - Varying response times may indicate route changes or load issues
- **Remediation:** 
  - For high latency: Investigate network routing and bandwidth
  - For packet loss: Check for network congestion or faulty equipment
  - For complete blocking: Consider allowing some ICMP for diagnostics
  - Document expected baseline ping results for comparison
  - Configure monitoring to alert on significant changes from baseline

   - Return `True` for success or `False` for failure
   - Register the check in `app/core.py` by adding it to `get_available_checks()`

2. **Example: Simple Web Screenshot Check**
   ```python
   # app/checks/screenshot.py
   import os
   from app.utils import run_command
   
   def web_screenshot(target: str, output_dir: str) -> bool:
       """Capture a screenshot of the target website."""
       if not target.startswith('http'):
           target = f"http://{target}"
           
       output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, "screenshot.png")
       cmd = f"wkhtmltoimage --quality 75 {target} {output_file}"
       return run_command(cmd, os.path.join(output_dir, "screenshot_log.txt"))
   ```

3. **Integration with External Tools**
   - Wrapper functions for commercial security scanners
   - API integrations with threat intelligence services
   - Custom checks for compliance requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
   - Industry-specific security tests

## Advanced Configuration

The tool supports various advanced configuration options:

1. **Configuration File Structure**
   - Located at `~/.config/serveraudit/config.json` by default
   - JSON format for easy editing
   - Supports environment-specific configurations
   
   Example basic configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "default_scan": "full",
     "output_dir": "/var/log/serveraudit"
   }
   ```

2. **Scan Configuration**
   - Settings for different scan types and tool parameters
   
   Example scan configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "nmap": {
       "tcp_options": "-sS -Pn --top-ports 1000",
       "service_options": "-sV -sC -p22,80,443,8080,3389",
       "udp_options": "-sU --top-ports 20"
     },
     "scan_threads": 2,
     "report_format": "html",
     "custom_checks": ["webscreen", "sslscan"]
   }
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   - `SERVERAUDIT_CONFIG`: Override default config path
   - `SERVERAUDIT_OUTPUT`: Default output directory
   - `SERVERAUDIT_DEBUG`: Enable verbose logging

**Configuration Options Reference:**

- `scan_threads`: Number of parallel threads for scanning (1-10). ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher values may trigger IDS/IPS
- `tcp_options`: Nmap TCP scan parameters (e.g., `-sS -Pn --top-ports 1000`)
- `service_options`: Service detection parameters (e.g., `-sV -sC -p22,80,443`)
- `udp_options`: UDP scan parameters (e.g., `-sU --top-ports 20`). Note: UDP scans are slower
- `report_format`: Output report format (`html`, `json`, `text`, `xml`). HTML provides best readability
- `custom_checks`: Additional modules to run (e.g., `["webscreen", "sslscan"]`). Defined in `app/checks/`
- `timeout`: Maximum time for checks in seconds (e.g., `300`). Default is module-specific
- `retry_count`: Attempts before failing a check (e.g., `3`). Helps with unreliable networks

| **Term** | **Definition** | **Related Concepts** | **Appears In Report Sections** |
|------|-----------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| **Attack Surface** | The sum of all points (attack vectors) where an unauthorized user can attempt to enter or extract data from a system. | Exposure, Attack Vectors, Surface Reduction | Port Scan, Service Detection |
| **Attack Vector** | A specific path or method that an attacker uses to gain unauthorized access to a system. | Vulnerability, Exploit, Entry Point | All Sections |
| **Brute-Force Attack** | A trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as passwords or directory names by systematically trying all possible combinations. | Dictionary Attack, Password Cracking | SSH Configuration, Account Security |
| **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** | A system that provides reference identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities. | Vulnerability Database, Security Advisory | Service Detection, Version Analysis |
| **Defense in Depth** | A security strategy that employs multiple layers of defense mechanisms to protect assets. | Layered Security, Multiple Controls | Security Recommendations |
| **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** | A network segment that contains and exposes an organization's external-facing services to the internet while protecting the internal network. | Network Segmentation, Firewall | Network Configuration |
| **Enumeration** | The process of gathering information about a target system to identify potential attack vectors. | Reconnaissance, Information Gathering | Port Scan, Service Detection |
| **Hardening** | The process of securing a system by reducing its vulnerability or attack surface by removing unnecessary functionality and configuring security settings. | Secure Configuration, Lockdown | Security Recommendations |
| **Lateral Movement** | The techniques attackers use to move deeper into a network after gaining initial access. | Privilege Escalation, Pivoting | Security Recommendations |
| **Least Privilege** | A security principle of providing users with the minimum levels of access necessary to complete their job functions. | Need-to-know, Access Control | Account Security, Filesystem Permissions |
| **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)** | An attack where the attacker secretly relays and possibly alters communications between two parties. | Eavesdropping, Traffic Interception | SSL/TLS Analysis, Network Security |
| **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)** | A nonprofit foundation that works to improve software security through community-led open-source projects. | Web Security, Top 10 Vulnerabilities | Web Application Security |
| **Penetration Testing** | An authorized simulated attack performed to evaluate the security of a system. | Security Assessment, Ethical Hacking | Methodology |
| **Privilege Escalation** | The act of exploiting a bug, design flaw, or configuration oversight to gain elevated access to resources that should be protected. | Vertical/Horizontal Escalation | Account Security, Filesystem Permissions |
| **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** | Systems that provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. | Log Management, Security Monitoring | Security Recommendations |
| **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** | Cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communications over a computer network. | Encryption, SSL, HTTPS | SSL/TLS Analysis |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness that can be exploited by an attacker to compromise system security. | Exposure, Risk, Exploit | All Sections |
| **WAF (Web Application Firewall)** | A firewall that monitors, filters, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application. | Application Security, HTTP Filtering | Web Application Security |
| **World-Writable** | File or directory permissions that allow any user on the system to write to or modify the file. | File Permissions, Security Misconfiguration | Filesystem Permissions |
| **Zero-day** | A previously unknown vulnerability being exploited before a patch is available. | 0day, Unpatched Vulnerability | Security Recommendations |
| **Zone Transfer** | DNS operation that replicates DNS records from a primary DNS server to secondary servers; can leak internal information if improperly configured. | DNS Security, Information Disclosure | DNS Analysis |

# FAQ

## General Questions

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---------|--------|
| **Can I use this tool on internal/private servers?** | Yes, the tool is suitable for both internal and public-facing servers. However, always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any system, and be aware that some checks may generate significant traffic. |
| **Will this tool make changes to my server?** | No, the Server Security Audit tool is designed as a read-only assessment tool. It does not modify system configurations or make changes to your server. All operations are non-intrusive. |
| **How often should I run security audits?** | For critical systems, monthly audits are recommended. Less critical systems should be audited at least quarterly. Additionally, run audits after significant system changes, upgrades, or before moving systems to production. |

## Technical Questions

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---------|--------|
| **What if a check fails or returns an error?** | First, check the detailed logs for error messages. Common causes include missing dependencies, insufficient permissions, or network restrictions. You can re-run individual checks with the `--checks` parameter after resolving the issue. |
| **Can the tool audit multiple servers simultaneously?** | The current version audits one server at a time. For multiple servers, consider creating a wrapper script that calls the tool sequentially or implements parallel execution. |
| **How resource-intensive are the scans?** | Resource usage varies by check. Port scans and directory brute-forcing are the most intensive. On production systems, consider running these checks during off-hours or use the `--checks` option to select less intensive checks. |
| **Does the tool work on cloud-hosted servers?** | Yes, but be aware that some cloud providers have policies against security scanning without prior notification. Some providers might also block scanning traffic. Check your provider's terms of service and security policies before scanning. |
| **Can I integrate this tool with my CI/CD pipeline?** | Yes, the tool can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Use exit codes to determine success/failure, and consider using the JSON output option (if available) for easier parsing by other tools. |

## Security Concerns

| **Question** | **Answer** |
|---------|--------|
| **Is using this tool detectable by intrusion detection systems?** | Yes, many checks (especially port scanning and directory brute-forcing) generate traffic patterns that may trigger IDS/IPS systems. Always coordinate with security teams before scanning production environments. |
| **Can I safely run this tool against production systems?** | The tool is designed to be non-disruptive, but intensive checks like comprehensive port scanning or directory brute-forcing can potentially impact performance. Consider testing during off-hours or on staging environments first. |
| **How does this compare to commercial security scanners?** | This tool focuses on common server security misconfigurations and exposures. Commercial scanners often include vulnerability databases and more extensive checks. Consider this tool as complementary to, not a replacement for, comprehensive vulnerability scanners like Nessus or Qualys. |
