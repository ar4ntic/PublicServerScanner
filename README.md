   wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=2 https://github.com/ar4ntic/PublicServerScan/raw/main/app/omates vulnerability scanning and security auditing processes to identify misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in internet-exposed systems. Designed for security professionals, system administrators, and DevOps engineers who need an efficient way to evaluate their external attack surface.

## Features

- **External Attack Surface Analysis**: Comprehensive port scanning to identify exposed services
- **Web Security Assessment**: Checks HTTP security headers and tests for directory brute-force vulnerabilities
- **TLS Security**: Analyzes SSL/TLS certificates for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- **Network Security**: Reviews firewall status and configuration to prevent unauthorized access
- **Remote Access Security**: Evaluates SSH configuration for hardening compliance
- **DNS Security**: Examines DNS configuration to prevent information leakage and zone transfer attacks
- **System Security**: Lists users with sudo/admin privileges and detects world-writable files
- **Actionable Reporting**: Provides clear recommendations prioritized by security impact
- **Non-Invasive**: Performs read-only operations that won't disrupt your production systems
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS with minimal dependencies

## Why Use This Tool?

PublicServer SecurityScan is specifically tailored for internet-facing systems where security vulnerabilities can lead to significant breaches. It functions as both a vulnerability scanner and security auditor, identifying misconfigurations and security weaknesses in externally accessible services. Security professionals use this tool to:

- Discover exposed services and potentially vulnerable endpoints
- Assess TLS/SSL configuration and certificate validity
- Identify risky server configurations before attackers can exploit them  
- Generate comprehensive reports for security compliance and remediation
- Schedule automated security posture assessments

The tool works on Linux, Windows, and macOS, requiring only Python 3.8+ and is designed to be integrated into your security operations workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before running PublicServer SecurityScan, you need Python 3.8 or newer.

- Some security checks require external command-line tools such as `nmap`, `curl`, `dig`, `openssl`, etc. Please ensure these are installed and available in your system PATH for full functionality.
  - On macOS, you can install most tools with Homebrew, e.g.:
    ```sh
    brew install nmap curl dig openssl
    ```
  - On Windows, you may need to download and install these tools separately (see their official websites).
- An active internet connection is recommended for certain checks.
- For best results, run the tool with administrator/root privileges.

### Windows
1. Download the latest Python 3 installer from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
2. Run the installer. **Important:** On the first screen, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
3. Complete the installation.

### macOS
1. Open Terminal.
2. Check if Python 3 is already installed:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```
   If you see a version number (e.g., `Python 3.9.7`), you are ready to go.
3. If not installed, install Homebrew (if you don't have it):
   ```sh
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
4. Install Python 3:
   ```sh
   brew install python
   ```
5. Verify installation:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

### Verifying Python Installation (All Platforms)
To check if Python is installed and available in your PATH, run:
```sh
python --version
```
or
```sh
python3 --version
```
If you see a version number 3.8 or higher, you are ready to proceed.

## Installation

You can install and run the PublicServer SecurityScan app without cloning the entire repository. Simply download the latest version of the app using `wget` or `curl`.

### Windows

1. Install [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if not already installed.
2. Download the main script and requirements file:

   ```sh
   wget https://github.com/ar4ntic/or w/main/StartScan.py
   wget https://github.com/ar4ntic/PublicServerScan/raw/main/requirements-dev.txt
   wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=2 https://github.com/ar4ntic/PublicServerScan/raw/main/app/
   ```
   Or use `curl`:
   ```sh
   curl -O https://github.com/ar4ntic/ServerSecurityAudit/raw/main/StartAudit.py
   curl -O https://github.com/ar4ntic/ServerSecurityAudit/raw/main/requirements-dev.txt
   # Download the app directory as needed
   ```

   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied**: Try running the script as an administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (macOS) for full access to system checks.
- **Module Not Found**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
- **Python Not Found**: Make sure Python 3.8 or newer is installed and available in your system PATH.
- **Download Issues**: If `wget` or `curl` is not available, you can manually download the files from the GitHub web interface.
- **Virtual Environment Issues**: If you have trouble activating the virtual environment, check your Python installation and consult the [Python venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
- **Scan Errors**: For detailed troubleshooting of specific security checks, refer to the [comprehensive documentation](documentation.md#faq).
